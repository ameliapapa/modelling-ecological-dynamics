This repository holds code from a Master's level Ecological Modelling university course at James Cook University, BS5260: Modelling Ecological Dynamics coordinated by Professor Sean Connolly. The first assignment consists of files papa_whale1.m and papa_whale2.m, where I generated extnction risk profiles for the northern right whale *Eubalaena glacialis* based on demographic rate estimates. In the second course assessment I constructed and analyzed two process-based models used in fisheries management: the Ricker and Beverton-Holt models (papa_ricker.m; papa_ricker2.m; papa_bevertonholt.m). Lastly, in files papa_prac7a - papa_prac7c I investigated trophic dynamics.
